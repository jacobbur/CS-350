# CS-350

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The artifacts submitted in this repository are for milestone three, using Morse code and project one, creating a thermostat prototype. For milestone three, the assignment was to use the LEDs on the board to signal in Morse code, the messages "SOS" and "OK." These messages alternated and looped indefinitely. For project one, the goal was to creat a thermostat prototype using the CC3220x board from Texas Instruments. In order to accomplish this, the temperature sensor on the board was used and combined with creating a setpoint within the code. If the temperature registered by the sensor exceeded the setpoint, the LED would turn off, and if the temperature was below the setpoint, the LED would turn on. In order to assist in testing this prototype, the two side buttons were used to adjust the setpoint. 


## What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I did well on the Morse code assignment. While I initially felt that it was a little out of my comfort zone, I quickly caught on and was able to meet all of the requirements for the assignment fairly quickly. In addition, I think that my work on project one, while it did take longer, was done so in a clean and effective manner that meets industry best practices.


## Where could you improve?
I could certainly improve in my familiarity in the assignments. This was the first time I had written code with any effect that could immediately be seen. Everything learned throughout this course was foreign to be until we went over it in the course. Additionally, I would like more time working with UART specifically, as I feel this is the area that I know the least as the course concludes. 


## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Working with embedded systems was not something that I had experience with prior to this course. I move on in mny studies proud that I was able to learn and work with them and hope that I can more in the future as well in order to further improve my skillset. 


## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Planning was a big part of this course for me. I had ran into an issue early on where I caught the flu. While it did set me back, I heavily relied on my ability to plan not only for the project but for the course as a whole. 


## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was able to do so using industry best practices. My code is readable and, I feel, maintainable by anyone that could potentially come after me that might use my work as a basis for their own or if someone was to ever need to maintain or improve upon the groundwork that I set.
